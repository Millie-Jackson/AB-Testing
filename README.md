# Dataset
The dataset is designed to analyze the groups, determine if the ads were successful, estimate the revenue generated from the ads, 
and assess if the difference between the groups is statistically significant.

## Data Dictionary
**Index:** Row index

**user id:** Unique identifier for each user

**test group:** Indicates whether the user saw the advertisement ("ad") or the public service announcement ("psa")

**converted:** Indicates whether the user bought the product (True) or not (False)

**total ads:** The total number of ads seen by the user

**most ads day:** The day on which the user saw the highest number of ads

**most ads hour:** The hour of the day during which the user saw the highest number of ads.
## Usage
This dataset allows for comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of marketing campaigns through A/B testing, 
helping companies to make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing strategies.

# Skills Demonstrated

**A/B Testing:** The project involves comparing the conversion rates between different groups (test groups) to assess the impact of different variables, 
which is a core part of A/B testing.

**Data Visualization:** The project extensively uses data visualization techniques such as count plots, pie charts, histograms, 
and box plots to visualize the distribution of different variables and their relationships.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The project performs univariate and bivariate analysis, including descriptive statistics and visualization to understand t
he data distribution and relationships between variables.

**Hypothesis Testing:** The project uses statistical tests (Chi-squared test, Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene's test, t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test) 
to test hypotheses about the differences in conversion rates across different groups and variables.
